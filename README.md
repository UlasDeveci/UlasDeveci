<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm UlaÅŸ</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am UlaÅŸ Deveci, a Physics undergraduate student at Marmara University and I have a great interest in Financial Markets. Specifically, I want to pursue a master's degree in Computational Mathematics. I am preparing for the SPL (Capital Markets License) Level 3 license exams. By obtaining this license, I aim to make a career as an analyst in the stock market. My physics education has made me strong in solving complex problems, thinking analytically, and interpreting quantitative data. I see the impact of the practical courses I took and took during my undergraduate education on not falling into emotional misconceptions about determining a strategy and implementing this strategy. By using these skills in financial analysis, I aim to apply them effectively in understanding the markets, predicting future trends and developing strategies.</h3>
